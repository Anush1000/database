Creating a README file is an essential step for documenting your project and making it easy for others to understand and use. Below is a sample README file based on the patient registration system project you've described. This README file includes sections for project description, installation, usage, API endpoints, and seeding the database.

### Sample README.md

## Project Description

The Patient Registration System is designed to manage patient registrations, including their personal details, photo, and assigned psychiatrist. It also supports retrieving information about hospitals and associated psychiatrists.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anush1000/database.git
   cd database
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB URI:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/patient-register
   ```

4. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.
